\section*{Media Summary}

It is said that science is advancing more rapidly than ever, due to the adherence to open sharing of data, code, methods and results. This may be true in some fields, but the reality is that the broad scientific community is still far from achieving frictionless reproducibility. I have many points of agreement with the article "Data Science at the Singularity" by David Donoho, but the scientific community needs to work harder to achieve the exemplars presented there. Challenges and opportunities in the pursuit of this ideal have to do with alignment of incentives, the need for better tools and platforms, training, and an unfinished cultural shift in the scholarly community.

\section{Line of Argument of the Article "Data Science at the Singularity" by David Donoho}
\label{intro}
David Donoho's paper ``Data Science at the Singularity'' argues that a transformative shift has occurred in computational research towards what he terms \emph{frictionless reproducibility}. He says that the last decade has seen a remarkable acceleration in research progress in some fields, propelled by the maturation of three core data science principles: data sharing, code sharing, and competitive challenges, now implemented as frictionless open services. This new era of research, exemplified by the rapid advancements in empirical machine learning, can leverage frictionless reproducibility to markedly increase the pace of scientific discovery and the spread of ideas. Donoho suggests that adhering to these principles allows for a seamless, efficient exchange of research outputs, fostering a community where innovation thrives on collective engagement and the iterative improvement of ideas.
